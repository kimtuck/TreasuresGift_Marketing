                                <p>My name is Laurie Hanson, and I recently wrote a book, "Treasure's Gift", an illustrated children's book.  I'd like to introduce myself and my book, and some options for a visit to your school.</p>
                                <p>My book, "Treasure's Gift", is a chapter book about the relationship between a young girl and her dog.  Annie is going through a tough time, moving away from her friends into a new home.  Her dog and best friend, Treasure, helps her find new friends.  It's a heartwarming story, richly illustrated by a local artist, and is meant for children in grades 1-3.</p>
                                <p>I'm a local author, having been in the Anoka-Hennepin School District my whole life.  I attended Ramsey Elementary school, graduated from Anoka High School, and have been a Ramsey resident for about 20 years.</p>
                                <p>Treasure's Gift is in the school library at Ramsey Elementary in Ramsey, Lincoln Elementary in Elk River, and at the Saint Paul Public Library, Anoka County Public Library, and Chaska Public Library.  Many teacher friends have bought the book for their classroom; and others have given copies to their teacher friends.
                                </p>

                                <p>I'm able to present several programs for your students.  These programs are offered at no cost, with the purchase of one or more books.  Each program is about 1/2 hour long, and can be presented to a classroom.</p>

                                    <li>Author reads the book to the class.  Read the book, then talk about the book.  What everyone liked, what it's like to have to move, how do you make new friends.</li>
                                    <li>How to write a book:  writing the story, how the book is illustrated, and how the book is put together.  I'll have copies of my original story, some of the paintings by the illustrator, and talk about the various people involved.</li>
                                    <li>Read to the dog: My Golden Retriever, Karma, is a registered therapy dog (through TDI International).  Students can read "Treasure's Gift" or other books to the dog, in a group or one-on-one.</li>
                                    <li>Dog behavior: what is good behavior in a dog, how to do (simple) tricks with a dog, how to take care of a dog.</li>
                                    <li>Custom program -- give me an idea!  For example, Karen Sherga at Coon Rapids High School is using Treasure's Gift to discuss empathy with her Child and Human Development students.</li>
